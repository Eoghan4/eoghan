<h1>Evaluation</h1>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Having now finished my artefact, I am able to look back and reflect on how it performs as a model of a real game. I am satisfied that the programme meets all of the requirements, both basic and advanced, as outlined in the brief. I feel that I have managed to recreate an accurate mode of Blackjack that can be played to completion in a number of modes, features an amount of randomness that makes every game different, includes more than the minimum amount of inputs, stores data from each game simulated, performs statistical analysis of the data, and displays this data in a visual format.</p>
<br>
<p>I am happy that I have fulfilled all of the objectives that I have previously outlined. I have managed to replicate the ability for the player to hit and stand, the Ace has a variable value that changes based on the value of your hand, and I have used the data collected to form strategies in relation to the game. I feel that I have stayed relatively close to my initial plan, and I have, through multiple iterations, managed to make my code more concise and efficient. I wanted to make the game as user friendly as possible, and through clear instructions, colour codes and allowing for multiple inputs, I believe I have done this.</p>
<br>
<p>If I were to further iterate my artefact to improve it, I would probably make better use of functions and classes in python to shorten the code. Functions and classes are great tools when simplifying code, and while I did make use of functions I didn't utilise them to their full potential and I didnâ€™t use classes at all. The shorter and easier to read your code is the better, as it allows you to edit it and fix problems much easier.</p>
<br>
<p>Overall, I am happy with the project and have learned a lot about python, creating models, testing systems and statistical analysis of data.</p>
