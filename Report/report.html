<h1>Leaving Cert Computer Science Project | 112092</h1>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>For my Leaving Cert Computer Science project, I have created a model of the card game Blackjack. This project's goal is to create a model that can run simulations in order to collect and analyse data, and Blackjack is a suitable game. The model requires multiple inputs to accurately analyse data, and Blackjack as a game gives the player oppurtunity to make choices about what to do with their hand.</p>
<br>
<p>Blackjack is a very popular card game where the objective is to have a hand of a value that is as close to 21 as possible without going over. The element of randomness that is created by a shuffled deck of cards makes this an ideal choice of game to model for this project, and the fact that this game is played against the dealer, not other players, makes simulation play easy to implement.</p>
<br>
<p>Each card is assigned a numerical value, with number cards being assigned the number on the card, and picture cards getting the following values:</p>
<br>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Card</th>
		<th>Value</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Jack</td>
		<td>10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Queen</td>
		<td>10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>King</td>
		<td>10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ace</td>
		<td>1 or 11</td>
	</tr>
</table>
